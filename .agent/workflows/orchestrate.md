# MANDATORY RULES — VIOLATION IS FORBIDDEN

- **Response language follows `language` setting in `.agent/config/user-preferences.yaml` if configured.**
- **NEVER skip steps.** Execute from Step 0 in order. Explicitly report completion of each step before proceeding.
- **You MUST use MCP tools throughout the entire workflow.** This is NOT optional.
  - Use code analysis tools (`get_symbols_overview`, `find_symbol`, `find_referencing_symbols`, `search_for_pattern`) for code exploration.
  - Use memory tools (read/write/edit) for progress tracking.
  - Memory path: configurable via `memoryConfig.basePath` (default: `.serena/memories`)
  - Tool names: configurable via `memoryConfig.tools` in `mcp.json`
  - Do NOT use raw file reads or grep as substitutes. MCP tools are the primary interface.
- **Read required documents BEFORE starting.**

---

## Step 0: Preparation (DO NOT SKIP)

1. Read `.agent/skills/workflow-guide/SKILL.md` and confirm Core Rules.
2. Read `.agent/skills/_shared/context-loading.md` for resource loading strategy.
3. Read `.agent/skills/_shared/memory-protocol.md` for memory protocol.

---

## Step 1: Load or Create Plan

Check if `.agent/plan.json` exists.

- If yes: load it and proceed to Step 2.
- If no: ask the user to run `/plan` first, or ask them to describe the tasks to execute.
- **Do NOT proceed without a plan.**

---

## Step 2: Initialize Session

// turbo

1. 설정 파일 로드:
   - `.agent/config/user-preferences.yaml` (언어, CLI 매핑)
2. CLI 매핑 현황 표시:

   ```
   📋 CLI 에이전트 매핑
   ┌──────────┬─────────┐
   │ Agent    │ CLI     │
   ├──────────┼─────────┤
   │ frontend │ gemini  │
   │ backend  │ gemini  │
   │ mobile   │ claude  │
   │ pm       │ claude  │
   └──────────┴─────────┘
   ```

3. Generate session ID (format: `session-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`).
4. Use memory write tool to create `orchestrator-session.md` and `task-board.md` in the memory base path.
5. Set session status to RUNNING.

---

## Step 3: Spawn Agents by Priority Tier

// turbo
For each priority tier (P0 first, then P1, etc.):

- Spawn agents using `oh-my-ag agent:spawn {agent_id} {prompt_file} {session_id} {workspace}`.
- Each agent gets: task description, API contracts, relevant context from `_shared/context-loading.md`.
- Use memory edit tool to update `task-board.md` with agent status.

---

## Step 4: Monitor Progress

Use `oh-my-ag agent:status {session_id} {agent_id}` to check process health.
Also use memory read tool to poll `progress-{agent}.md` for logic updates.

- Use memory edit tool to update `task-board.md` with turn counts and status changes.
- Watch for: completion, failures, crashes.

---

## Step 5: Verify Completed Agents

// turbo
For each completed agent, run automated verification:

```
bash .agent/skills/_shared/verify.sh {agent-type} {workspace}
```

- PASS (exit 0): accept result.
- FAIL (exit 1): re-spawn with error context (max 2 retries).

---

## Step 6: Collect Results

// turbo
After all agents complete, use memory read tool to read all `result-{agent}.md` files.
Compile summary: completed tasks, failed tasks, files changed, remaining issues.

---

## Step 7: Final Report

Present session summary to the user.

- If any tasks failed after retries, list them with error details.
- Suggest next steps: manual fix, re-run specific agents, or run `/review` for QA.
- Use memory write tool to record final results.
