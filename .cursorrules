# Talkie Agent Rules

## 1. High-Level Protocol
- **Proactivity**: When a feature is implemented, you must AUTOMATICALLY update all related artifacts without being asked.
- **Scope of "Done"**: A task is ONLY done when:
  1. Code is written and analyzed.
  2. Tests/Verification passed.
  3. `README.md` and Roadmap docs are updated to reflect the change.
  4. Localization (I18n) is updated for ALL supported languages (use English fallback for missing keys, never leave them undefined).
  5. Help/Guide UI is updated if the feature affects user interaction.

## 2. Deployment
- **No Local Builds**: Only `git push` is allowed for release.
- **Approval**: Must ask for confirmation before `git push`.

## 3. Localization
- **All Languages**: "Internationalization" means ALL 40+ ARB files. Do not just update EN/KO. Use scripts to propagate keys.
